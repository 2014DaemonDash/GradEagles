This program runs as a Java applet, utilizing many of the avaiable methods of the java applet feature. The game combines a simple idea into a hard to master game.
To play this game, the use simply taps the space bar to "collect" the recycleables. 
The game gets harder as the recycleables continue to increase in speed. 
If you fail to collect 6 recycleables in a row, then you lose. 
To dissuade users from using cheap methods to play the game, everytime a user presses space but does not collect anything, a point is deducted. 
Therefore the user must time his/her "collects" right in order to gain more points. 
The environment will change based on yours actions. 
If you keep missing items, and they go into the landfill (the end of the screen) the environment becomes more and more "disgusting", to the point where the player loses.
